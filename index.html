				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan’s School of Information.  My work draws on the fields of Anthropology, CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work), and ICTD (Information Communication Technologies & Development) to study how people collaboratively access and participate with internet technologies in constrained contexts.</p>
				<p>Drawing on my training as a sociocultural anthropologist, my work focuses on underserved groups to investigate (1) internet access in resource-constrained regions; (2) the design of citizen-led information systems; and (3) social media use for social change.</p>

				<p>Bridging the fields of anthropology, computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), and ICTD (Information Communication Technologies & Development), I use qualitative methods to study how underrepresented groups collaboratively access and participate with information communication technologies (ICTs) in politically and resource-constrained societies. Drawing on my training as a sociocultural anthropologist, my work investigates (1) internet access in resource-constrained regions; (2) the design of citizen-led information systems; and (3) social media use for social change.</p>
				<p>I received my Ph.D. in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. My dissertation analyzed how individuals in Havana, Cuba, collaboratively piece together multiple information infrastructures to create a uniquely “Cuban” internet against the backdrop of prohibitive access to the world wide web.</p>
				<p>At Georgia Tech, I was advised by Amy Bruckman and Neha Kumar and was a member of the ELC Lab and the TanDem Lab.  I am also a Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellow.</p>
				<p>I have a Master’s degree in anthropology from Georgia State University, specializing in cultural and digital anthropology. My research examined the use of Facebook for impression management and political activism by diasporic Hispanic groups. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Spanish from the University of Georgia, where my studies centered on Spanish media and culture.</p>
				<p>In between getting my degrees, I worked as a social media and public relations manager at organizations including Georgia Tech, Georgia Aquarium, Northside Hospital, and Cohen Wolfe. I’ve also worked as a private social media consultant for individuals, non-profits, and small businesses.</p>
				<p>I enjoy collaborating with researchers across a variety of disciplines to examine engagements with digital technologies among traditionally underrepresented groups. I am particularly interested in qualitative research methods, social computing, HCI4D, information communication technologies and development (ICTD), internet access interventions, hyper-local information infrastructures, e-democracy, activism through social media, and the virtual public sphere.</p>
				<p>I also enjoy exploring remote places, throwing impromptu dance parties, reading historical fiction, and playing with all kinds of animals.</p>
